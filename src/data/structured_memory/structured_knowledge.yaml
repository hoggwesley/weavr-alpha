      (Or: How a Scrawny, Sniveling, Crotch-Dry Failure of a Man Set Himself on a
      Collision Course with Destiny’s Sweaty, Swinging Ballsack)


      Scene 1: Screech the Walking Birth Defect


      Screech Powers was a biological mistake, a fucking error in the simulation that
      should have been scraped off the test tube and thrown into the goddamn ocean.


      From the moment he slithered out of his loser dad’s nutsack, destiny had one
      word for him: “No.”


      His whole existence was a perpetual slap in the balls.


      Puberty? Never showed up.


      Athleticism? He ran like a giraffe with polio.


      Charm? Screech had the social finesse of a man publicly shitting his pants on
      a subway.



      But the worst part?

      The absolute worst part?


      The motherfucker could not get laid to save his life.


      Lisa Turtle? Would rather chew glass and wash it down with battery acid than
      fuck Screech.

      Every other girl at Bayside? Would sooner cram a running chainsaw up their cooch
      than let him within 100 feet.

      Hell, even the school lunch lady—a one-eyed, 68-year-old chain smoker with a
      hook hand—once turned him down, mid-laugh.


      And Zack?

      Oh, Zack was loving every second of it.


      Scene 2: The Eternal Cuckhold of Zack Morris


      Screech thought Zack was his best friend.


      He was fucking wrong.


      Zack kept Screech around for one reason and one reason only—because standing
      next to this human colostomy bag made him look like a golden god.


      If Zack got caught cheating, lying, stealing, scamming—

      Screech took the blame.


      If Zack needed a distraction—

      Screech got pantsed in the cafeteria.


      If Zack needed to get laid—

      Screech was thrown at women like a fucking hand grenade, giving Zack just enough
      time to swoop in and close.


      And every time, Screech took it.

      He took it like a battered rescue dog, desperate for the love of the owner that
      beats it.


      But deep down?

      Deep down, Screech had a dream.


      One day.

      One day, he would get the girl.

      One day, Zack would respect him.

      One day, he would finally become a man.


      And that, my friends, is where this train to hell truly begins.


      Because fate had other plans.

      Fate had a 1,500-pound, fur-covered, nut-swinging, destiny-altering motherfucker
      waiting in the wings.


      And his name?

      The Camel.



      ---


      ACT 2: THE CHALLENGE OF MANHOOD


      (Or: How Screech Powers Found Himself Face-to-Face with a Goddamn War Beast
      from the Depths of Hell)


      Scene 1: The Devil’s Beast Arrives


      So here’s the deal—Bayside was a fuckin’ circus on a good day, but during Cultural
      Appreciation Day?

      That shit turned into a goddamn free-for-all.


      The school had zero budget, zero organization, and zero understanding of what
      "culture" actually meant.

      So what did they do?


      They called up some backwoods, meth-lab-having, inbred-animal-pimping motherfucker
      and rented whatever the fuck he had lying around.


      And what he had was a goddamn camel.


      This wasn’t some cute, petting-zoo, tourist-ride piece of shit you see in Egypt.

      Oh no.


      This was a prison-hardened, hate-filled, cum-stained desert war horse.

      A 1,500-pound, yellow-toothed, nut-swinging death machine, bred for vengeance
      and trained for nothing but destruction.


      And when the school unloaded that motherfucker into the quad?

      It immediately started chewing on a trash can and plotting a murder.



      ---


      Scene 2: Zack’s Final Fuck-You


      Zack had a gift.


      Not just for manipulation, not just for ruining lives, but for orchestrating
      a motherfucking masterpiece of destruction while making it look like he wasn’t
      even trying.


      And that’s why, when he saw Screech, sweaty, pathetic, desperate Screech, and
      saw that camel standing in the quad, swaying its balls in the breeze like a
      goddamn pendulum of fate—


      He knew.


      He knew this was it.


      So Zack did what Zack always did.

      He pulled that cockroach of a man close, slung an arm over his bony, unwashed
      shoulders, and whispered his final betrayal.


      “You wanna get Lisa’s attention?” Zack grinned.


      Screech nodded, his dumbass virgin brain lighting up like a redneck’s eyes at
      a Bass Pro clearance sale.


      “Then be a fucking man.”

      “Ride that camel straight into the Homecoming Dance.”


      Slater, overhearing this shit, dropped his Gatorade and choked on his own laughter.


      Jessie looked up from her feminist pamphlets, eyes wide with horror.


      Kelly crossed herself like a goddamn Catholic grandmother at an exorcism.


      And Screech?

      That dumb, clueless, nose-picking son of a bitch?


      He believed it.



      ---


      Scene 3: The Camel Knows


      Screech turned to the beast.


      The beast turned to Screech.


      And for the first time in his pathetic, piss-streaked existence, Screech felt
      something stir in his rotting, shrimp-dick soul.


      Destiny.


      This was it.

      This was his moment.

      His grand fucking transformation.


      So he did what no man, no beast, no rational lifeform should ever do—


      He took a step forward.


      The camel stopped chewing.


      It locked eyes with him.


      And right there, right in that moment, it was clear as day:


      This wasn’t just an animal.


      This was a sentient goddamn force of nature.

      This was a creature that had lived through war, famine, biblical plagues.

      This was a beast that had walked the sands of time, that had seen men come and
      go, that had smelled blood, cum, and suffering in the air.


      And this motherfucker knew.


      It knew Screech.

      It knew his sins.

      It knew his weaknesses.


      And worst of all?

      It hated him.


      It fucking hated him.


      But Screech?

      That dumb, desperate, pussyless bastard?


      He stepped forward anyway.


      And then, in a moment that would seal his fate forever, he whispered the words
      that would haunt him for the rest of his life:


      “I’m gonna ride you, big boy.”


      The camel blinked once.


      And somewhere, deep inside its prehistoric, evil fucking soul—


      It made a decision.



      ---


      Scene 4: The Mounting of Doom


      Screech, now fully committed to his demise, grabbed the reins of fate and clambered
      his bony, awkward, malnourished ass onto the beast.


      His pelvis hit camel spine.


      His sweaty palms clenched the reins.


      And for a moment?

      For one brief, shining, beautiful moment?


      Screech felt powerful.


      This was his moment.

      His ascension.


      He was no longer a joke.


      He was a warrior.


      A king.


      A man.


      And then, just as he flashed a smile, just as he prepared to bask in the glory
      of his transformation—


      The camel fucking snapped.



      ---


      Scene 5: The Beginning of the End


      The beast roared—a sound like a dying lawnmower getting skull-fucked by a grizzly
      bear.


      It reared back, launched forward, and


      BOOM.


      Screech was whipped backward like a fucking crash test dummy in a NASCAR wreck.


      The camel’s spine turned into a medieval catapult, sending Screech’s skeletal
      ass airborne like he was trying to punch a hole in the atmosphere.


      People screamed.

      Jessie dropped her clipboard.

      Slater straight-up pissed himself laughing.

      Zack was on his knees, sobbing with joy.


      And Screech?

      That worthless, doomed fuck?


      He was sailing through the air, flailing, screaming, arms and legs pinwheeling
      like a human helicopter crash.


      Then—impact.


      He landed face-first in a goddamn folding table, snapping it like a toothpick
      under an elephant’s ass.


      Desserts went flying.

      Belding shrieked like a dying goat.

      Lisa looked down at Screech’s broken, frosting-covered corpse and said, “I hope
      he’s fucking dead.”


      And above it all—standing tall, unchallenged, victorious—


      The camel simply chewed.


      It chewed like a motherfucker that had done this before.

      It chewed like it had been waiting for this moment its entire life.


      Because it had.

      Oh, it fucking had.



      ---


      ACT 3: THE BREAKING OF SCREECH


      (Or: How One Man Stared into the Abyss and the Abyss Took a Hot, Steaming Shit
      Right on His Face)



      ---


      Scene 1: The Vanishing of a Loser


      Screech was gone.


      Just fucking gone.


      One day, he was picking frosting out of his teeth in the quad, looking like
      a crackhead who lost a fight with a wedding cake.

      The next?


      Vanished.


      No one knew where the skinny, cum-goblin-looking son of a bitch had gone.

      And honestly? No one cared.


      The rumors started immediately.


      “He joined the military.” (He’d be dishonorably discharged the first time he
      tried to make eye contact with a female.)


      “He went to Mexico to start a new life.” (No Mexican on Earth would tolerate
      his fuckin’ whiny-ass voice.)


      “He’s dead.”



      That last one?

      That one felt the most accurate.


      And Zack?

      Zack was living his best fucking life.


      Bayside was peaceful now.

      No desperate, shrieking virgin orbiting Lisa like a retarded fruit fly.

      No weird, pube-mouthed goblin ruining every scheme.

      Just pure, uninterrupted victory.


      Or at least, it was peaceful.


      Until he came back.



      ---


      Scene 2: The Birth of a Creep


      Senior Year. Prom.


      The doors swung open.

      And there he was.


      Screech Fucking Powers.


      But something was different.


      This wasn’t the same knock-kneed, socially malformed, balls-shriveling mess
      that had gotten his spinal column rearranged by a camel.


      Oh no.


      This motherfucker was smirking.


      He was standing up straight.


      He was wearing sunglasses indoors like a goddamn sex offender who just discovered
      Reddit.


      He had a fake-ass patch of chest hair glued to his birdcage of a ribcage, peeking
      out from under a trench coat.


      And worst of all?


      He was trying to act cool.


      Zack nearly pissed himself laughing.


      Slater immediately said, “Absolutely the fuck not.”


      Lisa took one look at Screech and instinctively reached for her mace.


      Because this wasn’t the same pathetic pile of shit from before.

      This?


      This was the birth of a creep.


      And every woman in the room could feel it.



      ---


      Scene 3: The Pickup Artist’s Funeral


      Screech had a plan.


      Not a good plan.

      Not a functional plan.

      But a plan nonetheless.


      He had spent the last few months training.


      Reading every pickup artist book ever written.


      Practicing flirting on blow-up dolls.


      Watching “Alpha Male Grindset” YouTube videos until his brain turned into a
      dried-up, cum-stained raisin.



      And now?


      He was going to neg Lisa Turtle.


      He sauntered up to her like a pedophile trying to buy a Happy Meal with quarters.


      “Nice dress,” he muttered, adjusting his $5 gas station sunglasses.


      Lisa recoiled immediately.


      “You could wear something better, though,” he added.

      “Something that, I dunno, fits your body type.”


      The silence that followed was fucking biblical.


      The DJ stopped mid-song.

      Slater audibly gasped.

      A janitor in the back shook his head like he was watching a dog get hit by a
      semi-truck.


      And Lisa?


      Lisa did what had to be done.


      She maced the fuck out of him.


      Not just a little spray.

      Not a casual warning shot.

      The whole fucking can.


      Right in the eyes.

      Right in the stupid, greasy little rat face.


      Screech let out a scream that sounded like a eunuch getting circumcised with
      a chainsaw.


      He hit the ground, clutching his face, shrieking, rolling around like a dying
      roach.


      Zack?

      Zack fucking collapsed.


      This was his Sistine Chapel.

      This was his Mona Lisa.

      This was the greatest moment of his entire life.



      ---


      Scene 4: The Final Shred of Dignity Burns Away


      Screech, still fucking blind, still gagging on pepper spray, stumbled backward
      and fell straight into the goddamn punch bowl.


      A full table of cheap, neon-colored fruit juice and whatever backwash-ridden
      garbage Bayside was serving that night drenched his entire body.


      Now he was soaked. Sticky. Screaming.

      Blind and useless, just like he was always meant to be.


      The DJ tried to salvage the night, but there was no salvaging shit.

      People were cackling.


      The school photographer took a picture and immediately submitted it to Time
      Magazine for "Biggest Public Humiliation of 1994."


      Screech sat there, drenched, defeated, burned, humiliated.

      And then, something inside him broke.


      Like, fully, completely shattered.


      This was it.

      This was rock bottom.


      There was nothing left for him here.


      No redemption arc.

      No comeback story.

      No moment of triumph.


      This was the end of Screech Powers.


      He stood up—shaking, sticky, still partially blind—and walked out of the Bayside
      gymnasium forever.


      Not in anger.

      Not in shame.

      But in pure, hollow emptiness.


      Because he knew, deep down, that his true destiny awaited him.



      ---


      Scene 5: The Call of the Beast


      Screech wandered the streets of Bayside that night.


      Dripping. Shaking. Smelling like a hurricane of failure and fruit punch.


      No home. No plan. No hope.


      And then?


      He saw it.


      Standing under a single streetlight.


      Silent.


      Still.


      Chewing.


      The Camel.


      The same goddamn beast that destroyed him before.


      Its huge, black, soulless eyes locked onto him.


      And Screech?


      Screech felt something shift inside him.


      Because he wasn’t afraid anymore.


      No.


      He was ready.


      Ready to face his fate.


      Ready to accept what he had become.


      Because there was only one thing left for him now.


      One final trial.


      One last, unholy transformation.


      And the camel?


      The camel fucking knew it.


      It had always known.


      It was time.

      ACT 4: THE CAMEL’S REVENGE


      (Or: How Screech Powers Became the First Human Landfill to Get Fucking Flattened
      by a Feral Desert Beast in the Streets of Bayside)



      ---


      Scene 1: The Camel Comes for Its Due


      Screech stood there, staring at his final boss.


      The camel.


      That 1,500-pound, muscle-bound, piss-reeking war horse from the gates of HELL.


      It was silent. Still. Watching.

      Chewing like a motherfucker that already knew how this was going to end.


      Screech, that sniveling, bird-chested, failed abortion of a man, took a step
      forward.


      His shoes still squished with prom punch and regret.

      His entire being reeked of failure, mace, and the faint, lingering stench of
      Zack’s laughter.

      And yet—

      This dumb, twitchy, woman-repellent fuckstick was actually approaching the beast.


      A sane man would’ve turned around.

      A sane man would’ve gone home, opened a window, and done the world a favor by
      jumping out of it.


      But Screech?

      Screech had never been sane.

      Screech had never had a single rational thought in his entire cum-stained existence.


      So instead?


      He took a breath and whispered:

      “I’m not afraid of you.”


      The camel stopped chewing.

      Then, with the slow, unholy confidence of a creature that had seen men come
      and go and had ended them all the same way—


      It spit.



      ---


      Scene 2: The Baptism of a Fucking Loser


      Now, when I say the camel spit, I don’t mean some cute little dribble of saliva.

      No.


      This was a fucking tidal wave of hot, chunky, festering BEAST MUCUS.


      A full-blown nuclear strike of prehistoric phlegm, launched straight into Screech’s
      unsuspecting, dumbass face.


      The force knocked him back a full two feet.

      His knees buckled like an old man trying to shit standing up.


      And the smell?

      Jesus fucking Christ.


      Imagine rotting cabbage stuffed into a corpse’s asshole, left in the sun for
      six months, then deep-fried in sewage water.


      That’s what filled his nostrils, his mouth, his fucking SOUL.


      He stumbled, gagging, choking, trying to scrape the nightmare off his face,
      but it was everywhere.


      In his hair.

      Down his shirt.

      Pooling in the sad, empty pit where his chin should’ve been.


      And the camel?


      That sadistic, slow-chewing, hate-driven bastard?


      It took a step forward.


      Screech, for the first time in his life, felt true fucking fear.



      ---


      Scene 3: The Camel’s Final Lesson


      The moment Screech tried to run?

      The camel was on him.


      A thunderous, ground-shaking SLAM as 1,500 pounds of pure ungodly desert muscle
      pinned his bony, worthless body to the pavement.


      Screech let out a noise that wasn’t human.

      Something between a gurgle and a cry for his long-dead ancestors to come fucking
      save him.


      But no one was coming.


      Not Zack.

      Not Slater.

      Not Lisa.


      Just him.


      And the camel’s enormous, sweaty, pulsing weight crushing the last bits of oxygen
      from his bones.


      He tried to wiggle free, but the camel just pressed harder.


      His ribs made a sound like bubble wrap popping under a truck tire.


      His legs flailed uselessly, like a fish suffocating on land, like a pathetic
      little cum-gremlin struggling against the fist of God.


      And then, just when he thought this was it, just when he thought his sad, shriveled
      nutsack of a life was finally over—


      The camel let out a deep, primal grunt.


      And it began.



      ---


      Scene 4: The Unholy Completion


      Screech knew exactly what was happening.


      He knew it before his brain fully processed it.

      Before his lungs caught up with the cataclysmic, ungodly horror that was currently
      unfolding.


      He couldn’t see it.

      But he felt it.


      The camel was mounting him.


      Screech let out a final, desperate scream, a sound so shrill and so devastatingly
      pathetic that somewhere, an entire family of bald eagles just fucking dropped
      dead out of the sky.


      But the camel?


      The camel didn’t give a fuck.


      It had one mission.


      One final act of vengeance.


      It pushed.


      And Screech was lost to history.



      ---


      Scene 5: The Aftermath


      The next morning, the sun rose over Bayside.


      The birds chirped.

      The world continued.

      And Screech Powers?


      Screech Powers was gone.


      Not physically.

      No, the mangled, used-up husk of a man still lay there in the street, twitching,
      barely breathing, covered head to toe in camel spit, sweat, and his own failures.


      But the person Screech once was?

      That pathetic, sniveling, virgin ass-clown?


      Dead.


      Whatever crawled away from that street, hours later, would never be the same.


      The camel had rewritten him.


      The camel had erased whatever innocence, whatever glimmer of hope had once lived
      inside his bug-eyed skull.


      And from that moment on?


      Screech Powers was no more.

      ACT 5: THE FINAL METAMORPHOSIS (Part 2: A New Legacy of Filth)


      (Or: How Screech Powers Became a Human Plague Upon Society and Set the Stage
      for an Eternity of Camel-Haunted Degeneracy)



      ---


      Scene 5: The Final Escape Attempt


      Screech had two options.


      1. Face the camel and accept his fate.



      2. Run like a cowardly, piss-stained sack of failure and pretend none of this
      ever happened.




      So, of course, he picked option two.


      That night, Screech stole a beat-up Dodge Neon from a meth head in Bakersfield,
      gassed it up with change he found in a Waffle House parking lot, and drove straight
      into the desert.


      No phone.

      No plan.

      Just pure, pants-shitting desperation.


      He needed to outrun the nightmares.

      He needed to leave the camel behind.

      He needed to start over, somewhere, anywhere.


      But deep in his crusty, cum-stained soul, he knew.


      The camel wasn’t just behind him.

      It was inside him.

      It had become a part of him.


      And that’s when he saw the billboard.


      A massive, glowing monstrosity standing alone in the middle of the desert, its
      flickering neon letters buzzing against the silence of the night.


      It read:


      “WELCOME TO VEGAS, BABY. WHERE DREAMS GO TO DIE.”


      And Screech laughed.


      Because where the fuck else was he gonna go?



      ---


      Scene 6: Screech Powers, Vegas Legend


      Screech hit the strip like a goddamn plague.


      Within 72 hours, he had:


      Gotten kicked out of three casinos for trying to pawn a stolen VHS copy of The
      Land Before Time 2.


      Been banned from every strip club on the boulevard after getting caught jacking
      off to a cocktail menu.


      Started a street performance act called “The Screech Experience”, which was
      just him screaming into a traffic cone while shirtless.



      And somehow, despite all odds, he started making money.


      Not because he had talent.

      Not because he had charisma.

      But because Vegas is a vortex of degeneracy where people will pay to watch a
      washed-up, camel-haunted cryptid publicly unravel.


      And that’s when it happened.


      That’s when he met the men in suits.


      That’s when the real business started.



      ---


      Scene 7: Screech’s New Empire of Filth


      One night, while passed out in a strip mall parking lot, covered in chili fries
      and his own shame, Screech was woken up by three men in suits.


      One of them wore sunglasses indoors.

      One of them had a scar that made him look like he ate human flesh for fun.

      One of them had a voice like a nicotine overdose.


      And they had an offer.


      “We wanna make you a star.”


      Screech blinked.

      “Like, a real star?”


      “No, you idiot. A reality star.”


      And that’s how Screech Powers—failed comedian, failed wrestler, failed human
      being—became the face of the filthiest, most cursed reality show ever produced.


      SCREECH: THE MAN, THE MESS, THE TRAGEDY.


      A 24-hour livestream of his miserable, degenerate life.


      Cameras followed him everywhere.

      The world watched him sleep in dumpsters, eat expired hot dogs, and gamble away
      everything he had on rigged slot machines.


      And the worst part?


      It was a fucking hit.


      People loved watching this camel-tainted goblin ruin his life in real time.


      Millions tuned in.

      Vegas made him a mascot.

      The casinos hired him for appearances.


      And Screech?


      Screech became rich.

      Scene 8: The High Roller Falls Again


      For the first time in his camel-ruined existence, Screech had everything he
      ever wanted.


      Money.

      Power.

      The attention of the masses.


      And yet…


      The nightmares never stopped.


      Every night, he heard the chewing.

      Every night, he felt it watching.

      Every night, he knew—


      The camel had not forgotten.


      And one fateful evening, as he stood on the balcony of his penthouse suite,
      looking down at the neon hellscape that had somehow crowned him king…


      It happened.


      A shadow moved below.


      Screech’s heart froze.


      He leaned over the railing.


      And there, standing in the middle of the Las Vegas Strip—


      The camel.


      Waiting.


      Watching.


      Chewing.


      And that’s when Screech lost his fucking mind.

      Scene 9: The Final Descent into Madness


      Screech tried to warn them.


      Tried to tell his producers, his fans, the casino bosses—the camel was coming.


      But they didn’t listen.


      They thought he was playing it up for the cameras.


      “It’s just a bit, man.”

      “Great ratings, Screech, keep it up.”

      “Maybe we can get you a camel for real! Wouldn’t that be funny?”


      And that’s when he snapped.


      That’s when he grabbed a microphone, ran onto the casino floor, and screamed
      the words that would be his final legacy:


      “IT’S FUCKING REAL! THE CAMEL IS REAL! YOU’RE ALL GONNA DIE!”


      And in that moment?


      Something shifted.


      The lights flickered.


      The slot machines short-circuited.


      A single gust of hot desert wind blew through the lobby, carrying the scent
      of sand, sweat, and fate.


      And then, from the grand entrance—


      The doors swung open.


      And the camel entered.


      IT HAD COME FOR HIM.



      ---


      Final Scene: Screech Powers is No More


      There was no escape.


      The camel moved through the crowd like a goddamn grim reaper.

      The casino-goers froze in place, mesmerized, horrified, unable to look away.


      And Screech?


      Screech knew it was over.


      He dropped to his knees.


      And as the camel stood before him, staring down at its broken, long-suffering
      victim…


      It nodded.


      And Screech understood.


      Because this was never about revenge.


      This was destiny.


      This was what he was always meant to be.


      A legend.


      A warning.


      A man so irrevocably fucked by fate that he became something else entirely.


      And so, as the cameras rolled, as millions watched in stunned horror—


      Screech stood up.


      He took one final breath.


      And then?


      He climbed onto the camel’s back.


      The beast turned.


      And together, under the blinding neon lights, they rode into the night.


      Never to be seen again.

      Epilogue: The Legend Lives On


      Some say Screech died that night.

      Some say he became one with the camel, fusing into an immortal, twisted entity
      that still haunts the deserts to this day.

      Some say, if you listen closely on the Vegas Strip at night, you can still hear
      it—


      That slow, steady chewing.


      And one thing is certain:


      The camel always wins.
